If you want to test the design out, use GitHub's download repo feature to download it as a zip, extract the contents of the zip into one folder, and just open up any of the .html files! Ideally, start with index.html, but all the files should have traces to every other file. 
If you use uBlockOrigin, the design will break as uBO is active on files too, so you will need to either temporarily turn it off or manually turn it off on every page.
The primary highlight, and the part I am most proud of, is the search feature. Simply click on the searchbar and it will display the options. If you want to modify them to see how the search feature scales endlessly, open up the script.js file in any IDE/text editor you want and add new items to the array of pages, and everything should update automatically.
